The lunar calendar is divided into cycles of 60 years each, and each year has a combination of an animal and an element. There are 12 animals and 5 elements; the animals change each year, and the elements change every 2 years. The current cycle was initiated in the year of 1984 which was the year of the Wood Rat.</p><p>Since the current calendar is Gregorian, I will only be using years from the epoch 1924.<em>For simplicity I am counting the year as a whole year and not from January/February to the end of the year.</em></p><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>Given a year, return the element and animal that year represents ("Element Animal"). For example I'm born in 1998 so I'm an "Earth Tiger".</p><p><code>animals</code> (or <code>$animals</code> in Ruby) is a preloaded array containing the animals in order:</p><p><code>["Rat", "Ox", "Tiger", "Rabbit", "Dragon", "Snake", "Horse", "Goat", "Monkey", "Rooster", "Dog", "Pig"]</code></p><p><code>elements</code> (or <code>$elements</code> in Ruby) is a preloaded array containing the elements in order:</p><p><code>["Wood", "Fire", "Earth", "Metal", "Water"]</code></p><p>Tell me your zodiac sign and element in the comments.
